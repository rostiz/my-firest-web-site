    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>cascading style sheet , or cascading style sheet , is a style language that describes how the markup language is actually displayed [ 1 ] , HTML and It is mainly used for XHTML and can also be used for XML . It is a standard of W3C , and the degree of freedom in defining layout and style is high.
   The default file name [2] is style.css.
   If the markup language (ex: HTML ) is responsible for the body of the website , CSS is responsible for decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can decorate a website like a completely different website by changing only the CSS file while leaving the HTML structure intact.
   In the case of CSS3 , which is currently under development , a function that can replace images created with graphic editing programs such as shadow effects, gradients , and transformations has been added. In addition, various animation functions have been added, replacing Adobe Flash to some extent.
